Reason: Fixes critical bug where elements disappear when scrolling due to Framer Motion whileInView initial state issues. All 13 remaining files now use initial={false} pattern.
Self-Review: No issues identified. All 22 motion components across 13 files updated correctly. All viewport props preserved. PRESETS variants still work correctly. Special handling applied for inline initial states in ChangelogFeed.tsx and RoadmapTimeline.tsx.
Unblocked: Task 3.1.1 (Add visibility-first preset variants), 3.1.2 (Update CSS animation safeguards), 3.1.3 (Add transition:persist to critical animated sections)
